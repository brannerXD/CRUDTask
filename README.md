# CRUDTask

Branner Andrés Ramirez Zapata 

Turing

For this project, I used JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, and JSON.

I used the terminal to install and configure JSON on port 3000, although it was complicated and didn't work initially.

Naturally, I used JavaScript code I had on my GitHub to complete this activity. The most time-consuming part for me was the HTML and web design with CSS.

I realized there are concepts I still need to study since I couldn't complete the activity 100%, and I'm not satisfied with that.

I couldn't properly align the icons with their corresponding text on the left side where the navigation bar is located.

I also confirm that although the design took time, it didn't turn out exactly as requested.

I admit that I also used reused CSS code; however, I edited it since there are concepts I understand very well.

I used concepts such as:
CRUD
Role-based path protection
(Mock) authentication
API consumption with Fetch
Data persistence
DOM management and usage
Folder architecture for CSS and JS
